        Mentorlink application developed in collaboration with five other students for our Captsone Information Systems project. 
        We used an Agile approach to develop the website over the course of four, week-long sprints and communicated via Slack, Trello Boards,
        and Zoom meetings. We used REPL.it, an online develoment platform to give us the ability to write live code together remotely and collaborate
        without having to worry about accidentally overwriting someone's work. 
        <br>
        I was on the development side of the project, focusing on site navigation and functionality, utilizing JavaScript to enable page traversal
        and updating thread posts. Each week I participated in team meetings discussing our plans for the upcoming week's sprint, and the tasks we would take on to 
        accomplish those goals. We utilized a Scrum framework to organize our team roles, and throughout the week our "Scrum Master" would periodically 
        reach out to see how we were progressing through the sprint. 
        <br> 
        One of the biggest challenges we faced during this project was doing everything remotely, as ASU still had limited campus access in the Spring of 2021 when this was developed.
        Coordinating meetings, tasks, and general communication was slow-going until we started getting into the general workflow of online collaboration. Fortunately, this was our 
        second project I had worked on with this team, so it was a lot more seamless than the first project.

        This was one of the group projects I worked on for my Capstone in Information Systems class at ASU. This was the first project I worked on with this team, 
        and we would later work together on building our mentoring application. This first project was completed using an Agile approach with a Scrum based framework, 
        and consisted of three, week-long sprints. 
        <br><br>
        This project was more focused on functionality than aesthetics, as it was meant to serve as a laucnhing point for our team to work a bigger project.
        I was on the development team for this project and worked on implementing administrator functionality and restaurant review features primarily using JavaScript.
        <br><br>
        Through working on this restaurant search website I learned how important it is to understand the role every member of the team plays, and pay attention to the 
        functionality they are implementing, in order to ensure the code remains consistent and compatible. I had to work closely with the developers working on the login 
        and user profiles to make sure the administrator and restaurant review features utilized the features they were working on. Thanks to this coordination and consistent use
        of an updated Trello board, we were able to get our project to a presentable state that could serve as a foundation for bigger web apps in the future.
