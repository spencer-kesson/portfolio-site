              Hello! My Name is Spencer Kesson. I'm a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a degree in Computer Information Systems.
              <br><br>
              I am currently looking for full time opportunities in web development (full stack or specialized, react), database administration (SQL), or app/software develoment (HTML/CS/JS), Python, Java)
              My primary focus during my four years at ASU was on two main categories: 
              <br><br>
              <b>Systems and Database Development</b>:
              &emsp; Data management and software design has been an interest of mine since the Summer before my Junior year of high school. To
              keep things short and sweet: I got my first job at a call center where I had to work with a custom CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
              tool designed to maintain student loan information and call records for attempts to reach specific students. I spent a lot of time in
              highschool messing around with the built in query system in the CRM to filter what type of students would appear on my call list based on
              criteria like Loan Repayment Dates, Current Loan Status, Days Past Due [Calculated Field, (Difference from Last Payment Date to Last Due Date)], and more. 
              By the time my Senior year rolled around...
              <br><br>
              <b>Business Communication / Project Management</b>:
              &emsp; <i>"The quality of your life is the quality of your communication</i> - Tony Robbins
              <br>
              The other area I spent a great deal of time focusing on was business communication, where I learned how to give meaningful feedback on peers' work (and incorporate feedback I recieved into my own work),
              collaborate with a team and manage projects efficiently through implementation of Agile and Scrum methodologies, and much more. One of the most important things I learned from the business side of
              my degree is that in order create projects that deliver substantial value for a company, one must make sure understand as many levels of the business as possible. This includes understanding how customers 
              plan to use the software, management's overarching plan for the company/project, and the capabilities of each member of the team to take on the tasks needed to deliver a functional and complete project.

          Apart from programming and IT related interests, my main hobby is music. Every aspect of it from writing/recording/perfoming and more
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="filter-music">
        <p>
          I have been writing music since highschool and have been in two bands, plus I have several solo projects in the works as well. 
          Over the last few years I've been accumulating studio gear with the goal of one day having a semi-professional home studio
          to record tracks for my bands, friends, and solo ideas.
