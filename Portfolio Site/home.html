                    Hey, hey, hey! I'm moving along on the portfolio, setting up the screen size formatting was more time consuming than I anticipated, so I decided to take a couple extra days for this sprint.  
                    <br><br>
                    Without further ado, let's get into what I got done for this week! 
                    <br><br>
                    <br> - Formatted, cleaned up, and expanded on project descriptions in popup modals 
                    <br> - Setup formatting for small, medium, and large screens (still W.I.P, but now structure is there for every page on the site)
                    <br> - Contact Page overhaul! - embedded a Google contact form 
                    <br> - Added to the small/medium/large screen size media queries to handle the landing page image sizing 
                    <br><br>

                    Wednesdays seems like they've been working as a good deadline for my sprints, as I'm usually off work Thursday which allows me to start on the sprint
                    without being interrupted by having to go to my shift at Guitar Center. That said, planning the last sprint made me realize
                    I underestimated the amount of time some tasks would take to complete, hence the delay, so I'm going to estimate a little on the higher side for the time to 
                    complete certain tasks for the next sprint. 
                    <br><br>
                    Here's what I'm going to be working on for Sprint 4:
                    <br><br>
                    <br> - Fixing the typewriter intro
                    <br> - Portfolio Icon styling and formatting - more unique icons, focus on less visible image stretching (cleaner look)
                    <br> - Popup modal formatting tweaks for small and medium screen sizes (implement button in modal to popup powerpoints for smaller screens)
                    <br> - iFrame powerpoint formatting
                    <br> - Home screen images display tweaks
                    <br> - Persistent radio button selection for filtering across each page
                    <br> - Provide links to live code projects from repl.it ()
                    <br> - Stylized radio buttons 
                    <br><br> 

                    After that I'm gonna have to start overhauling the javacript on the site so elements don't take so long to load - plus I can add some css animations so elements don't just pop in. 
                    <br> 
                    I'm excited to see where this goes! 
                    <br>

                    Well alright, it's been 8 days since I published the first iteration of the site to my GitHub. 
                    For this sprint my goals were the following:
                    <br> - Make the landing page links to filter the site functional
                    <br> - Clean up header
                    <br> - Lightly format music section to fit with theme of the rest of the site
                    <br> - Clean up about me and add socials
                    <br> - Format for different screen sizes
                    <br> - Expand on project descriptions 
                    <br> - Contact Page functionality
                    <br><br>
                    I had a little less time this week, but I'm not about 
                    making excuses, so let's get to what I was able to implement. 
                    <br> - Cleaned up header
                    <br> - Added functionality to landing page buttons
                    <br> - Implemented local storage to keep track of user preference filter going from home page to portfolio
                    <br> - Formatted music section
                    <br> - Cleaned up view of modal popup window
                    <br><br>
                    I'm still happy with what I was able to get done, but for my next sprint deadline (May 6th), I'm going to focus on:
                    <br> - Formatting for different screen sizes
                    <br> - Contact Page Functionality
                    <br> - Optimizing JS for portfolio section
                    <br> - Detailed project descriptions
                    <br> - CSS optimization across site
                    <br><br>
                    Anyways, I have to get to work, looking forward to seeing where I'm at in a week!

                    Oh man, the fact that I'm starting out V.0.0.1 of this site with a hardcoded blog entry is going to drive me crazy, but it's
                    just a placeholder until I implement a database to store and retrieve these posts / plus I'm thinking some JavaScript to dynamically 
                    retrieve and show new blog entries. For V.0.0.1 though, I'd rather focus on creating a functional prototype (or Minimum Viable Product)
                    to serve as a launching point for new updates. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sure, I could use WordPress or an equivalent to host my portfolio, but where's the fun in that? 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyways...
