        <b>Mentorlink</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>Key Technologies Used:</b> HTML/CSS/JS, repl.it, Trello, Slack
        <br><br>
        <b>Project Description:</b><br>
        Mentorlink is a website I worked on in collaboration with five other students for my Senior Captsone class in Information Systems at ASU. 
        We used an Agile approach to develop the website over the course of four, week long sprints and communicated via Slack, Trello Boards,
        and Zoom meetings. We used REPL.it, an online develoment platform to give us the ability to write live code together remotely and collaborate
        without having to worry about accidentally overwriting someone's work -- if you're not familiar with it, think the Google Workspace but for coding.
        <br><br>
        I was on the development side of the project, focusing on site navigation and functionality, utilizing JavaScript to enable page traversal
        and updating thread posts. Each week I participated in team meetings discussing our plans for the upcoming week's sprint, and the tasks we would take on to 
        accomplish those goals. We utilized a Scrum framework to organize our team roles, and throughout the week our "Scrum Master" would periodically 
        reach out to see how we were progressing through the sprint. 
        <br> 
        One of the biggest challenges we faced during this project was doing everything remotely, as ASU still had limited campus access in the Spring of 2021 when this was developed.
        Coordinating meetings, tasks, and general communication was slow-going until we started getting into the general workflow of online collaboration. Fortunately, this was our 
        second project I had worked on with this team, so it was a lot more seamless than the first project. 
        <br><br>

      <b>Restaurant Search Website</b>
      <br><br>
      <b>Key Technologies Used: </b> HTML/CSS/JS, repl.it, Slack, Trello 
      <br><br>
      <b>Project Description:</b><br>
      This was the first group project I worked on for my Capstone in Information Systems class at ASU, and later on I'd continue to work with the same group to build our Mentorlink site. Throughout our time working togeter we used an Agile approach with a Scrum based framework. 
      Using these methodologies, and having our sprint goals listed out on our Trello board enabled us to collaborate efficiently and keep team members up to date on our progress -- even though at the time we were 100% remote due to the Corona Virus lockdown. 
      <br><br>
      This project was more focused on functionality than aesthetics, as it was meant to serve as a launching point for our second major project. Because of this, we were only given a limited timeframe to work with and it was completed in only three, week-long sprints. 
      I was on the development team for this project and worked on implementing administrator functionality and restaurant review features primarily using JavaScript.
      <br><br>
      Through working on this restaurant search website I learned how important it is to understand the role every member of the team plays, and pay attention to the 
      functionality they are implementing, in order to ensure the code remains consistent and compatible. For example, I had to work closely with the developers working on the login 
      and user profiles to make sure the administrator and restaurant review features utilized the the login/user privelage functions they were working on. Thanks to this coordination and consistent use
      of an updated Trello board, we were able to get our project to a presentable state that could serve as a foundation for bigger web apps in the future.

    <b>Project Description:</b><br>
    A group project I worked on with two other students for my Web Technologies class at ASU. Our goal for this project was to develop a new website for a local
    business that implments various features such as integration with a mySQL database to pull pricing information, a cart system that calculates total price, and a contact page
    with all relevant links and maps. This was my first project using node.js to enable access to a mySQL database, in this case, it was used to access menu pricing for the various dishes
    served by the restaurant.

            Lifter <br>
            Lifter is the main music project I'm working on at the moment. I've been working recording an album in collaboration with my best friend, Greyson, 
            since the Summer of 2020. We've have roughly 15-20 songs in the works, and we've been making music together since high school. We used to have a full
            lineup and were going to be a live band, but we decided we had more fun taking our time to write the music we want to write, on our own terms, rather than ending up in a position where we
            would be forced to make music to support our families. We both have full time jobs, and *gasp* adult responsibilities, but that doesn't impact the project too much since 
            there's no pressure of deadlines or monetary incentives pushing us to make the songs. Music is a hobby, and if people end up liking the songs we put out, then great, and if not, we're still
            gonna be making music because its fun.

            Busy Signals <br>
            The name is subject to change, but this is a solo metal project I'm working on. Usually these songs are born from me running my guitar into Cubase and messing
            around with random VSTs. I'm constantly going back and retracking/changing certain aspects of the songs as I learn more about mixing, but little by little
            I'm getting these songs where I want them to be.
